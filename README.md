# Dummy Fediverse Example

This is just a dummy fediverse example. Doesn't do much, if at all.

## Environment variables:

- `HOST`: the host part of the URL (e.g. in the URL `http://foobar/something`, `foobar` is the host, i.e. anything after the protocol (e.g. `http://`) and before the path `e.g. `/something`)
- `HTTP_PROTOCOL`: what HTTP protocol is used. Typically just either `http` or `https`
- `PORT`: The port number that the server should listen to. Note: `HOST` is independent of the port number. The purpose of the `HOST` and `HTTP_PROTOCOL` is the URLs generated by the ActivityPub and WebFinger server. The `PORT` is instead just to tell the server which port should it listen to
